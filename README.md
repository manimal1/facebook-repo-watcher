## A note on styles
I did not spend a lot of time styling the application.  I used the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) library.  I tend to use Sass in most projects, but I opted for using material-ui's standard JSS method of styling.  I chose this primarily for speed - but also because I wanted to test it out as I haven't had much opportunity to use it.  It was fun.
