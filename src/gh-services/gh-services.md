# 4. Github Services

This is where all the API calls to the Github API reside.

Axios is being used for http calls.

gh-services should:
- Be self-contained
- Only include calls to the Github API

gh-services should NOT: 
- Make calls to other services
- Contain Redux actions or other client-side functionality
